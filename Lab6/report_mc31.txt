Assignment: Wireshark Traffic Capture and Protocol Analysis
Date: October 17, 2025
1. Objective
The objective of this analysis was to capture live network traffic using Wireshark while
performing standard web browsing and network diagnostic activities. This report
summarizes the findings from the captured data, focusing on the most active protocols,
observed communication patterns, and key insights into the underlying network
operations.
2. Most Active Protocols
The packet capture was performed while visiting websites ( wikipedia.com)
and running a ping command to 8.8.8.8. Analysis of the captured packets in
capture_lab6.pcapng reveals that the traffic was dominated by standard web and network
protocols. The primary protocols observed were:
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP): This was the most active transport layer protocol,
responsible for the reliable delivery of web content. It carried the data for HTTP and TLS
(HTTPS) sessions.
User Datagram Protocol (UDP): This protocol was primarily used for Domain Name
System (DNS) queries and also for QUIC traffic, a modern transport protocol used by
Google services.
Transport Layer Security (TLS): As most modern websites use HTTPS, the TLS protocol
was highly active, encrypting the application data (like HTTP) between the client and web
servers.
Domain Name System (DNS): DNS traffic was observed at the beginning of web
requests, used to translate human-readable domain names (e.g., www.wikipedia.org) into
their corresponding IP addresses.
Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP): This protocol was generated exclusively by
the ping 8.8.8.8 command to check for network connectivity.
3. Suspicious or Unusual Traffic
During the analysis, no suspicious or malicious traffic was detected. All captured packetswere consistent with the actions performed (web browsing and pinging). The traffic
consisted of standard protocols like DNS, TCP, TLS, and ICMP communicating with
well-known public IP addresses (e.g., Google's DNS at 8.8.8.8, and the IP addresses for
the websites visited). The presence of protocols like ARP and QUIC is also normal for a
typical network environment.
4. Key Insights and Communication Patterns
The capture provided several key insights into the sequential and layered nature of
network communication.
DNS Precedes Web Traffic: The first step in accessing a website is a DNS lookup. The
capture clearly shows that before any TCP connection was made to a web server, a DNS
query was sent to a DNS server to resolve the website's name to an IP address. For
instance, a query for www.wikipedia.org had to be resolved before the browser could
connect to its server.
ICMP for Network Diagnostics: The ping command demonstrated the function of ICMP.
As seen in the icmp filter screenshot, the local machine (10.21.16.228) sent a series of
ICMP "Echo (ping) request" packets to the destination (8.8.8.8), which responded with
"Echo (ping) reply" packets. This confirms a live and reachable connection path between
the two hosts.
The HTTP Request/Response Cycle: The HTTP filter revealed the fundamental
communication pattern for unencrypted web browsing. The client sent an HTTP GET
request to the server (185.125.190.98 for wikipedia.com) to ask for the webpage content.
The server then responded with the requested data.
Prevalence of Encryption (HTTPS/TLS): While the filter for http successfully isolated
traffic to example.com, very little other web traffic was seen using this filter. This is
because most modern sites, including wikipedia.org, force connections over HTTPS. This
encrypted traffic runs over TCP port 443 and is encapsulated within the TLS protocol,
highlighting the modern web's focus on security. This was confirmed by the custom filter
ip.src ==10.21.16.228 && (tcp.port == 80 || tcp.port == 443), which showed significant
traffic on port 443 (HTTPS).
5. Conclusion
This Wireshark lab successfully demonstrated the ability to capture, filter, and analyze live
network traffic. The exercise provided practical insight into the roles of essential protocols
like DNS, TCP, ICMP, and HTTP. The key takeaway is that simple user actions, such as
visiting a webpage, involve a complex and rapid sequence of underlying network
communications that can be effectively observed and understood using network analysis
tools.
